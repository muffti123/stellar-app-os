# FarmCredit Smart Contract API Reference

All contracts are deployed on the Stellar network (Soroban). Invoke them via the Stellar CLI or the `@stellar/stellar-sdk` JS client.

---

## Contracts

| Contract | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tree-escrow` | Two-tranche donor escrow (75% on planting, 25% after 6 months) |
| `escrow-milestone` | Single-milestone escrow with remainder release |
| `location-proof` | ZK location proofs for Northern Nigeria boundary |
| `nullifier-registry` | SHA-256 commitment registry — prevents double-counting |
| `species-voting` | On-chain governance for adding new tree species to the catalogue |

---

## Common Patterns

### Authorization

Functions marked **admin-only** require the admin address (set at `initialize`) to sign the transaction. Functions marked **caller-auth** require the calling address to sign.

### Error Handling

Contracts panic with a descriptive string on invalid input. The Stellar SDK surfaces these as `InvokeHostFunctionError` with the panic message in `result_xdr`. Common patterns:

| Panic message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"already initialized"` | `initialize` called more than once |
| `"amount must be positive"` | `amount ≤ 0` passed to `deposit` |
| `"active escrow already exists for this farmer"` | Duplicate `deposit` for same farmer |
| `"no escrow for farmer"` / `"no escrow found for farmer"` | Farmer address has no escrow record |
| `"commitment already registered"` | Duplicate nullifier / replay attempt |
| `"location outside Northern Nigeria boundary"` | `in_region = false` passed to `submit_proof` |
| `"must hold TREE tokens to vote"` | Voter has zero TREE token balance |
| `"already voted on this proposal"` | Duplicate vote attempt |
| `"proposal has not passed"` | Attempting to execute a non-passed proposal |
| `"planting density below minimum for job size"` — Job area meets threshold but density is too low |
| `"area hectares must be positive"` — `area_hectares ≤ 0` |
| `"survival not yet verified"` — Attempting to call 1-year milestone before survival check |
| `"1-year milestone period not yet elapsed"` — Called before 1 year elapsed since planting |
| `"rating must be between 1 and 5"` — Rating outside valid range |
| `"can only rate after escrow is completed"` — Rating before job completion |
| `"only the original donor can rate the planter"` — Non-donor attempting to rate |
| `"sponsor has already rated this planter"` — Duplicate rating attempt |

---

## tree-escrow

State machine: `Funded → Planted → Survived → Completed` (or `Funded → Refunded`)

**Time-Locked Milestones (#494):** Funds are released in 3 tranches:
- Tranche 1 (30%) at planting verification
- Tranche 2 (40%) at 6-month survival check
- Tranche 3 (30%) at 1-year milestone

**Minimum Planting Density Rule (#514):** For jobs with `area_hectares` ≥ `job_size_threshold`, the contract enforces a minimum planting density of `min_density` trees per hectare. Small jobs below the threshold are exempt from density rules.

**Planter Rating System (#483):** After job completion, sponsors can rate planters (1-5 stars). Ratings are stored on-chain and aggregated into a reputation score (0-100) to track planter performance over time.

### `initialize`

One-time setup. Must be called before any other function.

**Auth:** deployer (anyone, once)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `Address` | Address that will act as verifier/admin |
| `tree_token` | `Address` | TREE token contract address |
| `oracle` | `Address` | Oracle address for survival reports |
| `survival_threshold_percent` | `u32` | Minimum survival rate (0..=100) for Tranche 2 |
| `min_density` | `i128` | Minimum trees per hectare for large jobs |
| `job_size_threshold` | `i128` | Minimum job size (hectares) for density rules |

**Returns:** `void`

**Errors:** panics with `"already initialized"` if called again.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID --network testnet --source deployer \
  -- initialize \
    --admin GADMIN... \
    --tree_token GTREE... \
    --oracle GORACLE... \
    --survival_threshold_percent 70 \
    --min_density 1000 \
    --job_size_threshold 10
```

```ts
await client.initialize({
  admin: adminAddress,
  tree_token: treeTokenAddress,
  oracle: oracleAddress,
  survival_threshold_percent: 70,
  min_density: 1000,
  job_size_threshold: 10,
});
```

---

### `deposit`

| `tree_count` | `i128` | Number of trees to be planted (must be > 0) |
| `area_hectares` | `i128` | Planting area in hectares (must be > 0) |

**Returns:** `void`

**Events emitted:** `DonationReceived(donor, farmer) → (amount, token)`

**Errors:**
- `"amount must be positive"` — `amount ≤ 0`
- `"active escrow already exists for this farmer"` — farmer already has an open escrow
- `"planting density below minimum for job size"` — Job area meets threshold but density is too low
- `"area hectares must be positive"` — `area_hectares ≤ 0`

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID --network testnet --source donor \
  -- deposit \
    --donor GDONOR... \
    --farmer GFARMER... \
    --token GUSDC... \
    --amount 10000000 \
    --tree_count 5000 \
    --area_hectares 5
```

```ts
await client.deposit({
  donor: donorAddress,
  farmer: farmerAddress,
  token: usdcAddress,
